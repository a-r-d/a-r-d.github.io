## Russia and "Foundations of Geopolitics"

I was reading something about the hacking that went on during the 2016 presidential election and stumbled upon a reference to a book entitled ["Foundations of Geopolitics"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics). The book appears to be a playbook that Russia has been following for the past decade or so. There are many actions the books says that Russia should take to destabilize [Atlanticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanticism).

Here are some events that have happened / are happening that the book proscribes:

| What was proscribed  | What happened  |
|----------------------|----------------|
| United Kingdom should be cut off from Europe. |  Brexit in 2016 |
| Ukraine should be annexed by Russia  | Crimean Peninsula was forcibly annexed by Russia in 2014  |
| Georgia should be dismembered.   | Russo-Georgian war of 2008  |
| In the United States: Russia should use its special forces within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism. For instance, provoke "Afro-American racists". Russia should "introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements â€“ extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics." | The rise of populism in the 2016 election, culminating in the election of an isolationist and protectionist president |
| Russia needs to create "geopolitical shocks" within Turkey. These can be achieved by employing Kurds, Armenians and other minorities. | Turkey and Russia are in a proxy war in Syria, Turkey is rapidly destabilizing internally |


## Russia and the next decade

The agenda Russia has set upon is working to isolate and diminish the United States from the rest of the world. The president-elect seems set to be following this course and it appears that much of the American public is happy to go along as well.

The Eurozone economy is weakening due to [banking issues](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/business/dealbook/italys-banks-are-in-a-slow-motion-crisis-and-europe-may-pay.html?_r=0) that continue to unfold and the rise of [populism in France](http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/15/politics/marine-le-pen-interview-donald-trump/), the UK, Greece, and other nations. Germany continues to [hold things together](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/11/21/germany-may-be-european-stalwart-against-authoritarian-populism-survey-suggests/?utm_term=.ea98da0c1884).

I predict that Russia will continue to extend it's sphere of influence over ex-eastern bloc countries and with an isolationist US and weakening EU, it may attempt to seize or integrate more territory. Economically I predict that US based multinationals will be stifled or expelled from these areas in favor of Russian based companies. I also can see a scenario where the US drops Russian sanctions and shifts toward Russia and away from China under Donald Trump (and the now apparent Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State).


## China and the next decade.

As the recent spate of [island building](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/30/world/asia/what-china-has-been-building-in-the-south-china-sea.html) and [subsequent militarization of said islands](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/15/world/asia/china-spratly-islands.html) has not abated, I believe China will continue to press into the South China Sea.

With the recent controversy over [Trump defying and questioning the "One China" policy](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/804848711599882240) it seems possible that China could react toward Taiwan in any manner of ways. I would not be surprised to see mainland China attempt to exert more control over Taiwan. I don't understand how the US could respond with effective sanctions given how closely our economies are integrated now.

I predict China will continue to grow and increase its presence on the world stage. The United States will not have many ways to curtail this, and China will continue to expel American companies from within its borders. The balkanization of the internet inside of China vs outside will continue unabated.


## Will a war happen?

I actually don't ever see China, Russia, The EU, and the United States engaging in open warfare. Each of these powers have nuclear weapons and fighting an open nuclear war would be suicidal to humanity. At least, from an investment perspective there is no point in considering an open nuclear war as a possibility because you may be effectively starting again back from the 19th century.

I expect that if trends continue there will be an increasing number of cyberattacks where nobody officially admits responsibility and proxy wars in territories bordering the superpowers.


## Investing in regions

From an investing perspective it makes a lot of sense to invest in companies that earn a majority of their income strictly inside of US borders, so places like Kroger or AT&T. They should be immune to geopolitical sanctions and retaliations to sanctions.

Alternatively, I believe that Russia and China will each grow stronger and dominate their spheres of influence. I think that Russia in particular may stage a comeback and the ruble will continue to rise. I like a lot of Chinese companies as investments (include Alibaba - BABA and Baidu - BIDU) but I am afraid that in the future there could be economic sanctions. Would I be forced to sell or lose these investments? I am not sure, but it seems like the probability is not zero.

In Europe I think that conditions may continue to deteriorate so I don't see how investing there would be particularly good going forward.

I believe that due to age demographics, Japan [the world's third largest economy](http://statisticstimes.com/economy/countries-by-projected-gdp.php), will not do well despite the success of Abenomics.


## Investing in human trends

I believe that we will continue to see a [rise in diabetes globally](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs312/en/) and that more people in more countries will be able to afford treatment. This should be good for drug companies that produce insulin and other treatments.


## Investing in AI

I can see a big shift toward self-driving cars and trucks as a serious possibility. This should impact tech companies, car manufacturers, insurance companies (commercial and for individuals), shipping companies, online retailers, and ride-sharing companies. But there is no clear bet you can make at the current moment of who could end up dominating here. Tesla seems to be overbought currently. Uber is not yet public, and it is unclear to me which other companies will benefit the most from the automation of trucking (maybe FedEx and UPS? Or maybe Amazon just gets their own robot fleets of trucks).

Otherwise, I think that in many instances AI and Machine Learning has become overhyped and not every business will be able to use it effectively. While companies may be able to use predictive analytics to shave of a 2% loss of product here and a 5% reduction in hours there, there will quickly be a point of diminishing returns.  


## The next recession in America

There doesn't seem to be a clear issue in the US that will cause the next recession. There are massive student loans, but the government owns most of them. There are [lots of Auto Loans](http://www.wsj.com/articles/total-u-s-auto-lending-surpasses-1-trillion-for-first-time-1439478198) at long durations and high interest rates but nobody seems to be very worried about it, since it's [small in comparison to mortgage debt](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/releases/mortoutstand/current.htm). Real Estate seems expensive across the country, but it is only too expensive in some markets and actually reasonable in many others. Stocks are at record highs and valuations are stretched ([as seen by the Case-Schiller PE](http://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/)), but this is probably due in large part to low interest rates for a very long period of time.

If the US really is in store for an infrastructure and building boom in an economy with already low employment (as people are predicting based on the Trump platform), then probably there will be a hangover. The economy can only burn white-hot for so long before all of the fuel is used up.


## Climate change

I don't know much about climate change science, although having an undergrad degree in Chemistry, perhaps I should follow it better. I do know that in the next decade it looks like alternative energy projects will continue and that [China will continue to invest heavily](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-renewables-investment-idUSKCN0WQ1IU). This all actually seems to be good news but whatever climate trends have begun are not likely to be reversed in the course of a decade.
