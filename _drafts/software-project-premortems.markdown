## Doing "premortems" for software projects

I'm currently reading the fantastic book "Thinking Fast and Slow" by the Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman. In the book he discusses plenty of topics, but in the section on optimism and over-confidence he introduces the idea of the "__premortem__". It's as it sounds: the inverse of a postmortem analysis. In his words here is the prompt:

> “Imagine that we are a year into the future. We implemented the plan as it now exists. The outcome was a _disaster_. Please take 5 to 10 minutes to write a  brief history of that disaster.”

The exercise is meant to make you ponder the issues that could crop up and avoid "group think" and over confidence that comes with it once a course has been set. The thing is, I think you can apply it to your own side projects and plans and it can be just as effective.



## Software is complicated, estimating is hard, blah blah blah

Everyone knows software is hard to estimate. It is difficult to predict which third-party API will cause your trouble and what last minute requirements the business will pile on. I'm a developer and I do side projects and freelance work, so I'm thinking on a very small scale here. I don't practice agile like I do at my day job, and I don't have planning meetings with myself.

What a premortem can really help you do in a solo effort is to sit down and characterize all of the things that may not go your way and give you an opportunity to plan to respond to them before they become major hindrances. And If you can avoid something up front that will later become a maintenance nightmare that is worth plenty. So, I think sitting down and doing the exercise is worth the 5-10 minutes in the long run. In fact, you probably already do this and I'm just putting a name to it here and formalizing it.

## Looking back, is there any project I would not have done?

Well, lots actually. I have done of a lot of side projects that could have benefited from a premortem, which as a result I would have abandoned sooner. In the past I have started projects where I wrote a lot of code, had fully built prototypes, and then did not know what to do next. I feel like premortems could have helped me a lot there.

One project in particular, where I was building job tracking software for small contractors makes me cringe when I think back to it (I called it _JobMinder_). I could have foreseen the problems had I sat down and put in some thought. I didn't have a clear idea of who my customer was and what I was building. I kept adding features before I even had a single beta tester. Then I slowly pursued beta tester companies with luke-warm enthusiasm for a while before losing interest myself.

What was my target market? Who was my customer? Am I intensely interested in this idea? What is my acquisition strategy? What features will be in my MVP? How much time will this take? How will I work on this while I have a full time job? Is there a point at which I would quit to work on this full time? I hadn't answered any of these questions.

If I had done a serious premortem, I could have thought about and potentially solved these issues first, before plowing time into it. I would have narrowed my plan down to something concrete. As it was I ended up with a ton of half-baked code and a lot of wasted time with nothing to show for it.




## As a non-decision maker, should you do premortems at work?

In my career right now I'm not in a position to kick off any major projects at the fortune 500 company I work at and probably never will be (especially since I'm just a consultant). You probably aren't either. That's just the reality of life, few people are true decision makers at that level. And once management has made a decision on some project you are not going to change their minds.

What you can decide is what train to board. I think you should do premortems of new projects before you join them at work, and probably the best way to do this is to get the opinions of a few of your co-workers. You are probably not in a position to understand all of the externalities that could make a project fail, but I bet that some of your co-workers are. This is the wisdom of crowds. If you find out something has a lot of serious risks, (maybe) you can avoid a potential layoff 6 months to a year down the line.



## What about a "Bias for Action"?

The one thing I don't like about the idea of a premortem is that they are so inherently pessimistic that they could cause you to give up on a idea that could be rather good. I think when most of us are on our deathbeds we will be regretting more things we didn't do as opposed to those we did. Anyway, that is at least the conclusion I have come to after reading many biographies recently. So I don't necessarily think it is ever good to discourage a bias for action.

What I do think is that the premortem should not discourage you from doing a project, but it should make you focus on the rough edges and crystalize your plan a bit more before you start. However, I think you should take risks when appropriate and doing a premortem should not discourage you from taking good risks. Although, I'm afraid that it could.




## What about prototyping?

I think there is a difference between fully committing to a new project and working on a prototype. I don't think you should apply a premortem to a project that is merely exploratory in nature. Building prototypes with minimal constraints can be fulfilling, and for a programmer seems like one of the best ways to get into a ["flow"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) state.

The trick may be to set some clear goals before you begin to prototype. Something like "use a generator so that I can prototype feature X in a web app" may be good (and _only_ feature X). Otherwise, you could get bogged down choosing a CSS framework or rolling a user Auth system. Getting bogged down in minutiae is not what you want to be doing in an exploratory phase.
