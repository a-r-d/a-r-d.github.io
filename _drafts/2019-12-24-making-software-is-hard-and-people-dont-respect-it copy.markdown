I have been involved (unsuccessfully) in the startups, bootstrapping, and indie hacker world of software development for a while. 

Before working on ITeach Recruiters and building courses I worked on the following things that ultimately failed (or I gave up on):  Released a product-as-a-service for the construction industry (I failed at B2B sales, and also had a threat of legal issues), had a paid mobile app in the app store related to cryptocurrency (the crypto winter happened) and ran multiple popular websites (killed by Google's SEO updates, lack of time, and again, the crypto winter). 

I have been involved in an ancillary way with many people who have tried to build startups. Mostly, they all either gave up or ran out of money or didn't have the time or resources to pull off what they were doing. 


## Software products fail frequently

It is so hard to build and sell a new software product. 

I recently went though my Twitter account and unfollowed all of the old accounts I was following. From about 2015-2017 I was really involved in going to meetups and hackathons and I had followed a bunch of founders and startup companies. Nearly every single one of these companies had been shut down (at the end of 2019). Nearly every founder I had followed on there is working for a big corporation now or working on a new startup. 

## Building Software is Hard

I was chatting with an older guy at a meetup and he was talking about how he once tried to build a software product and failed. He had a background in realestate and tried to build a SaaS product in a totally unrelated field. 

He said he burned through fifty thousand dollars with developers and they couldn't understand what he was saying when he talked to them. He said "talking to these people was like talking to the guys at the AV club". I think he meant nerds in high school. 

This outcome didn't surprise, me in fact it made me a little bit mad for how little respect people have for how difficult it is to manage a software project.

Communication is probably the hardest problem when working with a team to build software. But if you don't recognize this and respect it how is that supposed to work?

## Managing software projects is a discipline

I think a lot of "business types" get into building software without having read a single book about software project management. It's not like building a cookie-cutter house. You don't just hire a general contractor and knock out a plan you pick out of a catalog. 

Almost every software project has unique constraints and unique problems it is needs to solve. There is no blueprint you pick off a shelf, you need to make it yourself.
