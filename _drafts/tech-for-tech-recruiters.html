Recently, I have been thinking of teaching tech to tech recruiters. I want to create a video series where I cover technologies, engineering culture around technologies, and tips of finding developers. I will teach all of the components of webpages, server architecture, and databases at a high level. And, in more detail, I'll go over the various JavaScript frameworks and mobile frameworks being used on the client side. But most of all I want to teach recruiters things that will help them not waste their time.

How will I help recruiters not waste time? Well, let me give you an example. Fairly often, I get cold approaches (Linkedin, email, voicemail, ect) from recruiters about .NET positions. To anyone familiar with tech it would take just a cursory glance at my Linkedin profile or website will clearly see I am NOT a .NET dude! Actually, on my website, it literally lists <em>"things I don't do"</em> and .NET is on that list!

Do recruiters understand that the Java / Linux ecosystem is in some ways almost diametrically opposed to that of Windows servers and .NET? Somehow, as clearly a java dude, that writes Node.js code (something not popular on windows), and who mentions Windows nowhere on his online profiles, I am still getting .NET recruiter emails.

But, this is exactly the kind of thing I want to teach! These kind of ecosystem things are easy to grasp and remember and if you are a recruiter, you are going to be much more likely to get bites if you are using the correct type of bait to begin with. If you follow the same amount of leads but you are twice as selective about them, you are going to get twice the number of hits, all things being equal.

If this sounds good to you or you would like to pre-sign up before I start building this, please shoot me an email at aaron@ard.ninja and let me know what you want to see in the course. Otherwise, you can add your email to this list here and I will let you know when it is ready!
