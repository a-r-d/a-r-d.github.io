### Ideas for new posts

- Doing a mock burn rate analysis on a bootstrapped SAAS app
- Why Dice.com and other sites like it suck
- backend vs frontend for tech recruiters
- .NET vs Java for tech recruiters
- App dev vs web dev for tech recruiters
- Optimism and engineering mindset of "practical" vs creative mindset of "possible"
- Programming compared to bouldering with respect to problem solving
- Making youtube videos for class - show microphone and talk about strategy.
- Being a contractor vs being an employee.
- Being stuck on a maintenance mode project. How to make the best of it.
- Duplication of code across microservices (i.e. dry is hard)
- Diverging code bases in microservices (e.g. error handling, rest clients, logging)
- If Agile is so great, why is Agile in practice always such a joke?
- Making open offices suck less.

- Stopping regrets when making investment decisions.

- JavaScript for Java developers.

- Write about 2nd and 3rd order effects and how to practice thinking about them with Science Fiction. Use example of a house where planning a house is the base. Switching from wood to brick frame is the first action. 1st order is house is more expensive, 2nd order is now you cannot afford granite counter tops, 3rd order is now you have to redo the kitchen cabinets to match another countertop. From surface detail use the virtual consciousness -> virtual hells -> market for hosting these environments as 2nd order effect.
