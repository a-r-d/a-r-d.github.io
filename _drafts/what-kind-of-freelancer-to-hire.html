-Steve Jobs repeating his father's philosophy of craftsmanship to an employee.

That Steve Jobs quote comes from the Walter Isaacson biography, where Isaacson later goes on to describe how Jobs had memory chips re-arranged on the motherboard of the first Macintosh because they looked too close together. Jobs also fired the guy building the mouse because he insisted it could not be done to allow smooth scrolling in any direction. Jobs did not value form over function, he valued them both together highly and wanted every detail to have polish.

When a developer writes software he or she needs to make a lot of choices about what to focus on even before they begin to tackle your specific project. Sometimes you will find somebody that focuses intensely on front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript - basically the styling and function in the browser) and they know this area very well, but they when it comes to server side work they may not be very familiar with best practices. On the flip side, you can you have server-side programmers (back-end developers primarily write code to handle process and store data) that can build an amazingly robust and bulletproof system that will never lose your data but cannot style a simple form for a web page.

When hiring a freelance developer it can be very hard to figure out what you need. Many freelancers would consider themselves "fullstack" developers meaning that they do both front-end and back-end work but in truth, most have a specialty. I consider myself primarily a backend developer and when I get stuck on the client-side, I bring in help. Another distinction is between design work and front-end work. Sure, your front-end developer can build you a beautiful and functional Wordpress theme, but can they design it? Sometimes (well, often) you need to bring in a professional designer as well.

The theme I'm trying to flesh out here is the following: if you don't hire a full-service agency, you need to think about these roles yourself. You need to be the product owner and make sure the product gets all of the attention it needs from the appropriate professionals. Who will write the front-end code? Who will write the back-end code? Where will the design work come from? If your freelance developer you hired is asking you about where the mockups will come from, and if they can hire a designer, you should not brush him/her off.

What about SEO? What about social-media marketing? A freelance developer usually knows a little bit about these roles but you should not expect a lone freelancer to wear every single hat, learn their strengths and fill all of the roles. Doing your project with independent freelancers can be faster and cheaper than an agency but it takes more care.  Otherwise, you may end up plywood on the back side of your cabinet.
