description: What to do if you get stuck on a boring, maintenance mode project at work.

## My project at work is in maintenance mode, what do I do?

When you start a new job and you ask what happened to the person who had your role before you and the answer "they got moved to __insert sexy new project here__" then chances are you on a boring project that is now in maintenance mode. Everyone is trying to leave for greener pastures inside of the company. This has happened to me more than once in my short career and I had to figure it out.



## Master the task at hand

First, you have to master the task at hand. This may be easier than it sounds if you find yourself on a ten year old code base. Or, even a fairly modern code base with no tests or documentation would be challenging. But before your manager can think about going to bat for you and getting you transfered, you need to prove yourself. Yes, it sucks but you have to do it first.



## Make the best of it

You are now maintaining a project that is 10 years old and you have only a few hours of maintenance tasks to do per week. This seems to be totally OK with everyone so what do you do? Well, you could talk to your tech lead about doing a proof of concept for some cool new technology. You could finally get around to reading ["The Pragmatic Programmer"](http://amzn.to/2gBFK7q). It is research afterall. What else are you going to do? You have to make the best of all this time on your hands.

Yes it's cliche but do it: just make the best of it.



## Try to get transfered

I actually think there are a lot ways to do this. Talk to your manager obviously, let him or her know that you are bored out of your skull but don't expect them to be able to do anything. A more effective route is to get to know people on other teams and projects and find one you like that needs more people. Make sure you let the right people know that you are underutilized and your current project wouldn't miss you.



## Okay, I did all of that, what now?

If this all sounds crazy to you so far, then I would wager you have never worked at a big company before because I can assure you it's common. At this point your options are:

1. Keep trying to get transfered while making the best of it.
2. Find another job.

If you chose \#2, now you need to figure out how to select yourself into a position where you will not be jettisoned onto some boring project that has become a dumping ground for the new hires. This may prove hard since there are probably not many interesting programming at every company hiring programmers.
