## People prefer closed offices but open offices increase productivity.

[That is a fact unfortunately](http://iwsp.human.cornell.edu/files/2013/09/Work-Effectiveness-Communication-and-Office-Type-1vl9l9a.pdf). As long as open offices continue to increase productivity and communication we are probably going to have to live with them.


## A lot of people reaaaally hate open offices.

Check out [this post by Yan Lhert](https://medium.com/@yanismydj/why-i-only-work-remotely-2e5eb07ae28f#.iqn3vmefy). He has a lot of good arguments about why he will only work remote now, and in large part it seems to be because of open offices. He links to an especially great [tweet by David Heinemeier Hansson (he created Ruby on Rails)](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/671953192947736576).

## Visual distractions

I know that people walking by my desk frequently is distracting to the point where it upsets my work. I have solved this by moving away from walkways, putting up moveable whiteboards as makeshift barriers and changing the orientation of my desk. Actually I think having exposed desk near walkways is terrible in general and offices should just not be arranged that way. Somehow it always seems to happen though.



## Auditory distractions

Actually this one is pretty easy: over the ear headphones and some death metal. Okay, I am joking about the death metal part, probably more often Brahms or Bach for me. Anyway, grab a pair of these (Sony MDV-6), they block the sound outside well and your music will not leak out:

## Colds in the Fall and Winter

Okay, aside from getting a flu shot, I don't have any ideas here. Open offices suck for this, they just do. Your co-workers with kids with get sick first and then bring it to work and infect everyone else. It always happens, so make sure to stock up on sudafed.



## Be able to escape, at least for a bit

Work from home a few days a week, or at least have huddle rooms you are allowed to work out of. Sometimes you just need silence and no distractions, and modern offices don't allow that kind of luxury unless you are a C-level I guess. Even my bosses bosses boss is out in the open office, so I don't know where the insanity ends. I bet the CEO has whatever he wants though.
