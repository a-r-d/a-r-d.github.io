## People prefer closed offices but some evidence shows open offices increase productivity.

[These are both facts from at least one study](http://iwsp.human.cornell.edu/files/2013/09/Work-Effectiveness-Communication-and-Office-Type-1vl9l9a.pdf). As long as open offices continue to increase productivity and communication we are probably going to have to live with them. Anecdotally most developers I know either hate, slightly dislike or are indifferent to open offices. And at least [one other study seems to show that the downsides outweigh the benefits](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272494413000340#fig1).


## A lot of people reaaaally hate open offices.

Check out [this post by Yan Lhert](https://medium.com/@yanismydj/why-i-only-work-remotely-2e5eb07ae28f#.iqn3vmefy). He has a lot of good arguments about why he will only work remote now, and in large part it seems to be because of open offices. He links to an concise if perhaps hyperbolic [tweet by David Heinemeier Hansson](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/671953192947736576) (he created Ruby on Rails, if that name sounds familiar).

## Visual distractions

I know that people walking by my desk frequently is distracting to the point where it upsets my work. I have solved this by moving away from walkways, putting up moveable whiteboards as makeshift barriers and changing the orientation of my desk. Actually I think having exposed desk near walkways is terrible in general and offices should just not be arranged that way. Somehow it always seems to happen though.



## Auditory distractions

Actually this one is pretty easy: over the ear headphones and some death metal. Okay, I am joking about the death metal part, probably more often [Cannonball Adderley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannonball_Adderley) or Brahms for me. Anyway, grab a pair of these ([Sony MDV-6](http://amzn.to/2hplYhF)), they block the sound outside well and your music will not leak out:

## Colds in the Fall and Winter

Okay, aside from getting a flu shot, I don't have any ideas here. Open offices suck for this, they just do. Your co-workers with kids with get sick first and then bring it to work and infect everyone else. It always happens, so make sure to stock up on Sudafed and cough drops. In a good [New Yorker article Maria Konnikova](http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-open-office-trap)* throws out some numbers related to how often workers get sick vs the number of workers in an open space. Unsurprisingly, there is a correlation.

_* Unrelatedly Konnikova [wrote a great book on con artists](http://amzn.to/2hXdTQg) that you should read, it was entertaining and well researched._


## Be able to escape, at least for a bit

Sometimes you need silence and no distractions, and modern offices don't allow that kind of luxury unless you are a C-level (I guess?). So what do you do? Work from home?

I don't like to work from home for the same reason that I chose study in the library everyday in college rather than at home. Yes, I could study back in my room, but realistically there were more distractions. So for me, working from home does not seem like a great option, although for some people I bet working from home is a way to escape from the hectic office occasionally.

The best option may be stealing a huddle room. As I mentioned, I blocked my desk from the hallway with whiteboards, but that is more like a bandaid on a cut arterty. If you really need a moment of deep focus, stealing a meeting room is probably your best option.
