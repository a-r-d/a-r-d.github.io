      I have a few articles about investing and trading especially with regards to automated
      trading strategies. I also have some articles regarding using data analysis to predict security prices.
      You should be aware that investing is risky and you can lose some or all of
      the money you invest. The market can move against your quickly and wipe out your principal.
