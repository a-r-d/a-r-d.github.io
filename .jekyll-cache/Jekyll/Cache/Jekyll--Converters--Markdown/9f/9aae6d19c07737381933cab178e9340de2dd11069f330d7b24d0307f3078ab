I"ñ<p>I am readying through â€œSecrets of A JavaScript Ninjaâ€ right now and learning tons of helpful little tricks. The coolest thing I saw in there recently was the section on array-like objects, e.g. â€œargumentsâ€. So it is pretty simple - all of the array methods exist on Array.prototype and you can use the function method â€œcallâ€ and â€œapplyâ€ on these. Surprisingly this works great, so now you can do forEach, slice, ect on your arguments objects even though it is not an array.</p>
