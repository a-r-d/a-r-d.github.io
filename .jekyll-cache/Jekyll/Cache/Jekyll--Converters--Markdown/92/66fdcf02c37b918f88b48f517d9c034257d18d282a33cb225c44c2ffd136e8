I"ø<p>I went out for walk today and happened to listen to podcast about E-Book self publishing for the Kindle Unlimited program. This got me thinking about books I wish had been written, and an idea popped into my mind: â€œComputer Science for the Self Taught Programmerâ€. My undergraduate degree is in chemistry and I only was able to bring my programming skills up to a professional level through a whole lot of painstaking trial and error. I built dozens of silly software projects, read tons of programming books, and only later on realized I had a deficit of true computer science knowledge. To remedy this I worked my way through text books (<a href="http://amzn.to/23RlBhv">Cormenâ€™s Into to Algorithms</a>) and Udemy courses on the subject matter.</p>
