I"b<p>In the last one of these I tried to make a list of projects that would take one weekend
to get a big start on. Well, one weekend is pretty limiting and chances are you cannot do anything
truly novel. What if you had 4 full working weeks? With regular 40 hour work weeks
that is 120 hours of time on a project. What if you had 3 times that amount?</p>
