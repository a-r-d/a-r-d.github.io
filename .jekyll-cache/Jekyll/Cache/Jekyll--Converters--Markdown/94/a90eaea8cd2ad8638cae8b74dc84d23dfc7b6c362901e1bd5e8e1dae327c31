<p>Rather than using <code class="highlighter-rouge">node-inspector</code> on Node 7 and 8 you can now use chrome dev tools debugger with a special flag (<code class="highlighter-rouge">--inspect</code>), then navigating to <strong>‚Äúabout://inspect‚Äù</strong> in chrome. It looks something like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># this opens the process up for debugging
node --inspect server.js

# this breaks execution immediately
node --inspect-brk server.js
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unfortunately, this feature does not work in the current LTS version of Node.js (version 6.11.0). Paul Irish did a <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/05/devtools-release-notes">great presentation at Google IO 2017</a> describing the new features in Dev tools that were added to support Node.js debugging.</p>

<h2 id="you-can-quit-using-node-inspector">You can quit using node-inspector</h2>

<p>Ultimately you can now stop using <code class="highlighter-rouge">node-inspector</code>, if you are able to upgrade to the latest version of Node. The Node Inspector is a heavy dependency to keep in your dependency tree and you should get rid of it if you can, additionally the featureset that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">node-inspector</code> project can offer has already fallen behind what chrome dev tools provides.</p>
