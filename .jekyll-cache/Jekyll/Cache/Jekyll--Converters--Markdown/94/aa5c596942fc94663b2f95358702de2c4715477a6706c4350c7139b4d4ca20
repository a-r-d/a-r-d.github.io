I"÷<p>For the past six or seven years I have accidentally been doing an experiment. While in my junior and senior year in college (I was doing a chemistry degree) I made a YouTube channel on a fairly obscure chemistry topic that only upper level chemistry students take. The videos immediately started to get views since nobody else bothered to make videos on this topic and ever since I uploaded the initial videos (about 25 in total) I have not touched the account (I have not uploaded more videos).</p>
