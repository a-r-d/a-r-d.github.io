I"*<p>There are fields where dilettantism cannot cause any harm. Algorithmic trading is not one of these. Because if you are writing a program to automatically make you money, you can just as easily write on to automatically lose you money. Remember what happened to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Capital_Group">Knight Capital</a>? In this post Iâ€™ll describe a few algorithmic trading experiments I did with crytocurrency, as someone who has never worked in this field professionally (trading) I hope I can be forgiven for any errors.</p>
