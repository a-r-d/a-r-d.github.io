I")<p>I have been listening to a lot of Indie Hackers podcasts lately, and it is making
me want to work on another side project. I had to shut down my last project
(submittalextractor.com) due to a patent issue, which really pissed me off
and me turned me off of doing side projects for a while.</p>
