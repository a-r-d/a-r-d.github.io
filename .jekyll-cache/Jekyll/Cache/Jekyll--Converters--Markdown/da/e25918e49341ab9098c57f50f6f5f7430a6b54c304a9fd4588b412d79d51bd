I"E<p>Did you know that you can now send push notifications to a browser even when the user is no longer on the page? The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/notification">notification API</a> allows you to pop up OS level notifications from JavaScript. With <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers">Web Workers</a> you are able to register a worker permanently in a browser that will handle these notifications offline. Iâ€™m going to outline how to do this with Google Chrome and Google Cloud Messaging.</p>
