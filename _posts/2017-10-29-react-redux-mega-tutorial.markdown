## A React Redux tutorial from idea to deployment.

I just released a [set of youtube videos]((https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWRvoIK5KFymTrMa7mzvxuxl5ei_MyeF7)) that cover building a full site in React with Redux from start to finish.
I wanted to a tutorial on React so I decided to do something a little bit different.
I decided to build an entire site, basically screen record the whole the thing and
then deploy it, open source, it and in the process try to build something actually useful.

## Using "Create React App"

For the tutorial I started with Facebook's "Create React App", the reason is that
it did not have a backend and it does not come with Redux wired up by default. So as part of the tutorial
I was able to focus on client side and add Redux, build some actions, and then finally
add routing using react-router-dom.

## Ok So where is it

The actual site is here - [it's called "fpvbuildcalc.com"](http://www.fpvbuildcalc.com).
