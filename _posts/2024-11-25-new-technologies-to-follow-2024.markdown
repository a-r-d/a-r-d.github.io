title: New technologies to follow in 2024
---

__You know, the drill. As usual this is not investment advice.__

### New Information Technologies

| **Technology** | **Why are they interesting?** |
| --- | --- |
| ZK proofs (Zero Knowledge tech) | Share confidential information w/ out revealing it. The applications go way beyond just crypto. Useful for healthcare, government, finance, etc. |
| Homomorphic encryption | a way to do computation on encrypted data. e.g. can produce a voting machine where all results are encrypted but you can sum the votes accurately. |
| LLMs (large language models) | Enables a lot of stuff that was previously impossible. Can manipulate and text better than humans. Can learn and perform zero shot (no training) tasks. |
| Diffusion models | Enables creation and analysis of images with little to no training. |
| Multimodal models | multiple types of data, e.g. text + audio + image |
| Reinforcement learning models | e.g. teaching a robot how to walk. Solve a complex task by continually trying to do it. |
| Graph nueral networks | models designed to work w/ graph structured data. Can learn and make predictions based on relationships between data |
| Decentralized Identity (DID) | a way to authorize & authenticate users w/ only decentralized networks. Becomes increasingly important especially w/ AI. |


### New hardware technologies

| **Name / Category** | **Description** | **Example Companies** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Galium nitride semiconductors | As opposed to silicon it has higher efficiency and can be useful for lower power consumption | Cree, Efficient Power Conversion, GaN systems. |
| Solid state batteries | solid electrolyte instead of liquid. Allows for higher density & faster charging | Quantumscape (?) |
| High density 3D Nand | 128 layer 3d NAND memory. Increase density + capacity of solid state drives | Samsung, western digital |
| Micro LEDs | microscopic LEDs, offer superior brightness & power consumption to OLED / LCD displays | Apple, samsung, LG |
| High power fiber lasers | Multi KW continuous wave output now possible. Defense, manufacturing applications. | IPG Photonics, Coherent corp, nLight |
| Ultrafast lasers | Extremely short pulse lasers - imaging, research, materials processing (manufacturing) | Amplitude lasers group, Spectra-Physics |


### Moonshot companies to follow. Public or large enough to go public soon.

| Company | Technology | Details | Current Thoughts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IonQ | Quantum computing | their qubits are more stable and they developed a way to network multiple quantum computers together | Valuation seems extremely high. Compared to Rigetti I’m not sure it makes sense now, but all of these (quantum computing stocks) seem like strictly science projects now. |
| Cerebras | AI chips | They make full wafer sized chips. They are publishing benchmarks on llama-3.2 that are insanely fast. | They plan to go public soon but are held up by CIFIUS |
| CoreWeave | AI Datacenters | They are building AI datacenter capacity all around the world. Probably a buyout target. | Plans to go public soon, they are one of the only pure play ai datacenter companies. |
| Helion Energy | Fusion | Approach is interesting because they are building a solution to directly capture electromagnetic energy so you don’t need a steam plant to get electricity from it.  | Its private, their newest machine should have some interesting results. Sam Altman invested. Microsoft invested. Polaris prototype eta is 2024 so its behind schedule now. |
| Zap Energy | Fusion | Another different and interesting fusion approach.  | They just raised another 160 million last month, but I am having a hard time finding information on timelines.  |

There are also several interesting space companies, I will add to this list.
