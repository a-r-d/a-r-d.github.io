title: Selling People What They Want, Not What They Need
description: A crucial mistake is selling people something they need, not what they want. Wants are what people seek out to purchase.

Last year (in fall of 2019) I took almost 4 months off work to do an experiment. I decided to start a business solving a problem I thought that a lot of people had and wasn't being addressed.

I made [a video course to teach recruiters how to talk to software engineers](https://www.iteachrecruiters.com/).

I knew for a fact (as an engineer who gets contacted by recruiters nearly every day) that this was a real problem and the majority recruiters have very little understanding of what the industry they are recruiting for and the people they are contacting.

But, it was a hard sell. Many recruiters didn't _want_ to learn this stuff. They didn't see this as valuable and how it translated into more money for them.

## I didn't understand the recruiting industry at first.

I should first explain, the recruiting industry is special in many ways:

1. The turnover rate is high. Many recruiters wash out of the industry in less than a year.
2. The customer is the hiring manager, not the candidate.
3. Much of the industry is made of large firms that are based on hitting numbers and metrics.

## They didn't _want_ it.

The fact was, I was trying to sell people something they **need** but not what they **want**. Recruiters wanted more leads. They wanted more replies to their emails.

But, what they actually **needed** was to understand the industry so they didn't waste their time contacting the wrong people. Unfortunately, I had to educate my prospective customers about this before I could make a sale.

I tried to create a [body of evidence and data using surveys](http://localhost:8000/blog/january-2020-developer-survey-on-recruiting/) to prove this. I had to do this because I had to convince people.

If you sell a customer a thing they already **want**, there is no hurdle of convincing them and changing their mind. They know they want it, now it just comes down to product and price. But I tried to do something that requires an argument first.

I couldn't even figure out how to do advertisements for my course because the google search traffic for the keywords was so low. Recruiters were not searching for the thing I was making!

## The big recruiting firms

Just didn't care. They have training courses and what I was doing was redundant to them. Anyway they didn't seem to care a whole lot about building relationships. From my perspective (having interacted with these folks a lot as a candidate) they just seemed to care about placing a whole of people really quickly and if that meant emailing and calling a hundred people a day, well that is how it would be done.

To be fair, I've spoken to some really nice folks working at the big firms. But I certainly never made any sales, even if I pointed out that they contacted me about a C# job when I clearly had a Java background ðŸ¤£.

## I was trying to sell to recruiters, but I needed to sell to managers.

Because I didn't realize the focus on hitting numbers and high wash out rate I started off trying to sell courses directly to individual recruiters.

I realized if I tried to sell to individual recruiters I would have to price the course cheaply and do a huge amount of volume. And I would have to convince every single person that they wanted this thing. I just couldn't see a way to make it work.

After I understood this I decided to make the price higher and sell to more experienced managers at small recruiting firms. The managers knew that this information would make a difference and help recruiters form better relationships with candidates. **The pain point for them was providing this training ad-hoc to every new hire.**

These recruiting managers and owners of search firms already understood the need and wanted this because it would save them time in training their new recruiters.

This is how I found the **want** in the market. I finally started to gain traction.

**Then the pandemic hit and hiring and spending slowed! But that's a story for another time...**
