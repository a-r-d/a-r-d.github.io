  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>
    I spent the last few years as CTO of Bounty, a VC funded startup. Before
    that I was a tech lead consulting for PwC, and a senior engineer at
    companies such as Dharma and Target.
  </p>
  <p>
    My work has most recently involved managing engineering teams offshore &
    onshore as well as building out the infrastructure & backend architecture
    for a high growth startup.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm deeply experienced in scaling and parallelizing typescript based lambdas
    in AWS, and generally an all around experienced programmer.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm always interested in contracting / consulting opportunities so please feel free to
    reach out.
