  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>
    I'm an experienced software engineer and I have been CTO of Bounty (a VC
    funded startup) for the past 2 years. Before that I was a tech lead
    consulting for PwC, and a senior engineer at companies such as Dharma and
    Target.
  </p>
  <p>
    My work has most recently involved managing engineering teams offshore &
    onshore as well as building out the infrastructure & backend architecture
    for a high growth startup.

  <p>
    I'm always interested in consulting opportunities so please feel free to
    reach out.
