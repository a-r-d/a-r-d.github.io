<div class="home">
  <p>
    I build quality web apps using industry standard best practices. On the server side I primarily write Node.js and Java, and on the client side I'm using both React and Angular. I'm interested primarily in web development and recently have done a lot of work around performance optimization both on the server side and client side. I take on small freelance projects from time to time.
